## Introducing *PassTxt*: Your All-in-One Automation and Security Solution

In a world filled with diverse devices—Windows PCs, Macs, Android phones, iOS tablets, Linux machines, smart TVs, and even locked-down work computers—managing secure access and repetitive tasks can be a challenge. Software-based password managers and automation tools often fall short, requiring app installations that aren’t always possible due to compatibility issues or security restrictions. They may also lack advanced features like automation scripting or macro support, leaving users to manually handle complex passwords and tedious workflows.
