### **How to Grant GitHub Actions Read and Write Permissions**

This guide explains how to enable **read and write permissions** for GitHub Actions to allow workflows to push changes to your repository.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **1. Navigate to Repository Settings**
1. Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab at the top of the page.

#### **2. Access Actions Settings**
1. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on **Actions** under the **Code and automation** section.
2. Select **General** from the expanded menu.

#### **3. Modify Workflow Permissions**
1. Scroll down to the **Workflow permissions** section.
2. Select the **Read and write permissions** option to allow workflows to write to your repository.
   - This is required for tasks like pushing changes to a branch.
3. (Optional) Check the **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** box if your workflow involves pull request automation.
4. Click the **Save** button to apply the changes.

### **Why Enable Read and Write Permissions?**

GitHub Actions workflows run with limited permissions by default. If a workflow attempts to:
- Push changes to a branch.
- Modify the repository's contents.

Without write permissions, the workflow will fail with errors like:
```
remote: Permission to <username>/<repository>.git denied to github-actions[bot].
fatal: unable to access '<repository URL>': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

Granting **read and write permissions** resolves this issue by allowing workflows to perform write operations.

### **Verification**
After enabling read and write permissions:
1. Trigger the workflow again by pushing changes to the relevant branch (e.g., `main`).
2. Check the **Actions** tab in your repository to confirm the workflow runs successfully.
3. Verify that the changes are pushed to the target branch (e.g., `release`).

### **Security Considerations**
- Ensure only trusted workflows are present in your repository to prevent misuse of write permissions.
- For private repositories or sensitive operations, consider using **personal access tokens (PAT)** as an alternative for fine-grained control.
